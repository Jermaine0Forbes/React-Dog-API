**Random** or **Breed**
3. If you choose "Breed", type in the searchbar which breed of dog you would
like to see. If the breed doesn't exist, you will receive an error message 
4. If the API call is successful you should have three different dogs to choose
from. Click the **Add Breed** button in order to add a dog to the collection list
5. In the collection list you will see the image of the dog, the name of the breed
in the middle, and the option to remove the dog when you click
